			<h3>About This Dashboard</h3>
			<p>
				I am trying out 75 hard and logging my progress as i go. This is my
				second attempt at 75Hard, the first time i failed after 4 days. At the
				time of starting this journey(Oct 1, 2020) i have taken a break from my
				day job and will be focusing on improving myself for the next few days.

			<h3>About The Blog</h3>
			<p>
				Over the past few years i have become increasingly intersted in
				everything fitness. I have spent a lot of time reading, watching and
				listening anything related to nutrition and weight training.
			</p>
			<p>
				As so much had been cramped in my head, i though i really needed a place
				to clean and sort the information i had and hence i put it here incase
				it might come in handy for someone starting this journey. Most of the
				things have been written as someone who has been losing weight for quite
				sometime. I dont have much experience with bulking/gaining weight.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything here is according to my past experiences and my
				understanding, so please feel to correct me if you feel i am wrong
				somewhere. You can find different ways to contact me at the end of this
				page.
